Alchemist Stack: Package Changes Log
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Summary:
----------------

0.1.0.dev1 -- April 24th, 2018:
    Initial Release
0.1.1.dev1 -- May
    Changed RepositoryBase to subclass from ABC
    Added `instance` abstract+class method


Release Details:
----------------

Release v0.1.0.dev1, April 24th, 2018

Initial project release, configured for Python3 (v3.6.4), however untested for Python2 (whomp, whomp). Thinking about
it, it probably hella would not work in Python2.

Currently uses SQL Alchemy (v1.2.4), and supports the following databases & drivers:

  * postgres
    - psycopg2
    - pg8000
  * mysql
    - mysqldb
    - mysqlconnector
    - oursql
  * oracle
    - cx_oracle
  * mssql
    - pyodbc
    - pymssql
  * sqllite

This is meant to be a bare-bones release, so a lot of features are not quite there yet. I just need to push it out so I
can start using it.

Cheers.

Release v0.1.1.dev1

To support thread safe environments, I started implementing an `instance` method in classes that inherit from the
RepositoryBase. This `instance` method is now an abstract method that users must at the very least implement in
repository objects that inherit from RepositoryBase. To ensure this, the RepositoryBase object now inherits from ABC
(Abstract Base Class), which
